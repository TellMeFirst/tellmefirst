# TellMeFirst

TellMeFirst is a tool for classifying and enriching textual documents via Linked Open Data.

TellMeFirst leverages NLP and Semantic Web technologies to extract main topics from texts in the form of DBpedia resources. Input texts are enhanced with new information and contents retrieved from the Web (images, videos, maps, news) concerning those topics.

The TellMeFirst project started in October 2011 thanks to a [Working Capital â€“ Premio Nazionale Innovazione grant from Telecom Italia] (http://www.workingcapital.telecomitalia.it/2011/10/tellmefirst/). It has been developed mostly within the [Nexa Center for Internet & Society at the Politecnico di Torino (DAUIN)] (http://nexa.polito.it/tellmefirst).

A demo of the software can be explored at: [http://tellmefirst.polito.it/] (http://tellmefirst.polito.it/).
