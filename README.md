TellMeFirst
===========

TellMeFirst is a tool for classifying and enriching textual documents via Linked Open Data.

TellMeFirst exploits [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/) Indexes for its classification and enrichment system. To build the TellMeFirst Indexes you can exploit our [fork of the DBpedia Spotlight project](https://github.com/TellMeFirst/dbpedia-spotlight/tree/tellmefirst).
