TellMeFirst Indexes Builder
===========================

This is the main page for the documentation of the [TellMeFirst Indexes Builder](https://github.com/TellMeFirst/dbpedia-spotlight/tree/tellmefirst), based on a customized version of [DBpedia Spotlight project](https://github.com/dbpedia-spotlight/dbpedia-spotlight/wiki).

TellMeFirst exploits 3 [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/) Indexes for each language (English and Italian): (i) the **Corpus Index** necessary to the classification stage of documents, (ii) the **Knowledge Base Index** and (iii) the **Residual Knowledge Base Index** that provide support to the image retrieval system at the enrichment stage.

To build TellMeFirst Indexes, you may want:

* Install the project in your system: see the installation [guide with Maven](https://github.com/TellMeFirst/tellmefirst/tree/master/doc/build-index/Build-from-Source-Code-with-Maven.md).
* Set up your environment: see how to import the project in [IntelliJ Idea](https://github.com/TellMeFirst/tellmefirst/tree/master/doc/build-index/Setting-up-IntelliJ-IDEA.md).
* Build the [Corpus Index](https://github.com/TellMeFirst/tellmefirst/tree/master/doc/build-index/Corpus-Index.md).
